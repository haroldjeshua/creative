        <p>Hey, Harold here.</p>

        <p>
          I&apos;m the man behind{" "}
          <span className="font-display text-2xl uppercase">Harv Creative</span>
          .
        </p>

        <div>
          From the name itself, we are crafting{" "}
          <em className="inline-flex gap-1">
            creative digital experiences <Sparkles />
          </em>{" "}
          for the web, whether it be{" "}
          <Badge className="rotate-2">websites</Badge>,{" "}
          <Badge className="rotate-3">web apps</Badge>,{" "}
          <Badge className="-rotate-2">user interfaces</Badge>,{" "}
          <Badge className="rotate-1">product design</Badge> and anything
          pixel-related, to push more creative boundaries within the industry.
        </div>

        <p>
          I started building websites 5+ years ago and with the experience I
          gained through that time, it has been my{" "}
          <span className="font-light italic">lifelong dream ðŸŒ </span> to start
          a small side gig to help organizations and business to elevate brands
          and products for the community.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&apos;ve been working between{" "}
          <span className="font-light uppercase">digital design</span> and{" "}
          <span className="font-display text-xl">software engineering </span>
          to carefully curate things between different disciplines that way we
          can craft exceptional projects that exceed people&apos;s expectations.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of our goal is to bring high-quality products that stand out among
          others. We want to{" "}
          <em className="border-b border-dotted border-foreground">
            raise the standards of digital work
          </em>{" "}
          in my country as we believe software should be beautiful, accessible,
          and helpful to the community.
        </p>

        <p>
          We design and build with thought, attention to details and care for
          the business. Every projects and products that we launch is made
          specially for you by a{" "}
          <span className="border-b border-dashed border-foreground">
            senior-level creative
          </span>
          .
        </p>

        <p>
          If you&apos;re looking for someone to collaborate and take your
          projects to the next level, someone you can create a culture of craft
          with and build a long-lasting relationship with, you&apos;re in the
          right place.
        </p>
